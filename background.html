            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>I am originally from just outside Boston, Massachusetts. While I was initially interested in screenwriting, storytelling and people, I studied physics at the University of California, Los Angeles. I became involved in high-energy and astroparticle physics, the same research area where my father, <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Joseph-Kochocki" target="_blank">(Joseph Kochocki)</a>, completed his graduate work and several postdoctoral positions during the early development of the field.</p>

            <p>I chose to pursue graduate work in this area at Michigan State University. My research utilized the products of high-energy particle interactions to probe the dynamics of jetted astrophysical structures. This experience also provided a unique opportunity to consider the anthropology of research communities.</p>

            <p>Growing up within the political and cultural landscape of the United States, I developed an interest in the structure and variation of American families. My current work partially centers on how cooperation, innovation and persistence in human populations depends on extended family organization and resource flow.</p>

            <p class="caption">Several pictures taken by my father in the mid 1980s of the Soudan Underground Mine (northeastern Minnesota). <i>As a child, I dreamt of mine shafts.</i> This was the site of the Soudan proton decay and cosmic-ray experiments. On the left, a portion of the 23rd mine level prior to installation. On the right, proportional array tubes for integration. In the center, the inclined mine elevator. </p>
