            <h2>Research</h2>
            <p>My research is motivated by several domain-specific themes, including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Preferential cooperation and resource redistribution within families and extended genealogical networks</li>
                <li>The relationship between resource stress, innovation, and persistence in human populations</li>
                <li>The role of peripheral or low-connectivity agents, outsiders, and other perturbations on normative group behavior</li>
                <li>Multiscale responses of cooperative networks under stress, from individual and familial units to communities and nations</li>
            </ul>
            <p>These phenomena are only partially understood and likely reflect a combination of biological constraints and culturally learned behavior.</p>
            <p>My research focuses on developing mathematical models relevant to these questions, with applications to related problems in ecology, anthropology, and sociology. I am particularly interested in:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Applications of measure-theoretic probability and stochastic processes</li>
                <li>Interacting particle systems and formal frameworks for agent-based models</li>
                <li>Characterizing dynamic network structure, transport, and interaction processes on networks</li>
                <li>Scaling limits relevant to spatiotemporal population dynamics</li>
                <li>Statistical inference for complex and partially observed systems</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Across these areas, my goal is to identify minimal, interpretable models that connect local interaction rules to large-scale population-level behavior.</p>
            
            <h2>Selected Preprints and Work in Progress</h2>
            <ul style="padding-left: 0; margin-left: 0; list-style-position: inside;">
            <li> <i>Threshold Redistribution on a Network</i> (in prep for Journal of Theoretical Biology). A stochastic model of threshold-based resource redistribution on dynamic networks, studied through a two-dimensional stepping-stone population model with lineage-dependent cooperation. Focuses on the relationship between dynamic network topology, resource density, and population persistence. </li>
            <li> <i>Statistical Inference for a Rare-Event Process with High-Dimensional Observational Data</i> (thesis section, work in progress). Develops inference methods for rare-event stochastic processes under partial observability, motivated by point-source and diffuse analyses in high-energy astroparticle physics. </li>
            <li> <i>Machine Learning Processes for Observational Data</i> (thesis section, work in progress).  Examines classification and generative modeling through a probabilistic lens, with emphasis on uncertainty, identifiability, and the role of modeling assumptions in partially observed systems. </li>
