            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>My research focuses on the mathematical modeling of biological populations and human social systems. I use agent-based models, stochastic processes and network analysis to study the collective dynamics, transport, and spatiotemporal scaling limits resulting from local interactions. I am especially interested in the relation between familial and genealogical network structure, resource transport, persistence and social organization.</p>
            <p>I was trained as an experimental physicist, completing undergraduate and graduate work in high-energy and astroparticle physics. My doctoral research involved statistical inference for rare-event processes, numerical modeling of transport and interaction, and data analysis using classical statistical methods and machine learning. Much of this work was carried out within large experimental collaborations, including IceCube.</p>
            <p>Over time, my interests have increasingly shifted toward the study of social and biological systems. I am especially interested in applications to human populations, where network organization and resource flow play a central role in shaping large-scale societal outcomes and innovation.</p>
            <p>I am currently completing my doctoral work as a visiting graduate student in Munich and will be on the market for postdoctoral positions beginning in summer or fall 2026.</p>
