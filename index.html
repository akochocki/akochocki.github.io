                    <p>My research focuses on the modeling of biological populations and interacting particle systems. I use network analysis, probability and scaling arguments to study the collective dynamics and transport resulting from local interactions. I am especially interested in the relation between familial and genealogical network structure, resource redistribution, persistence and social organization.</p>
                    <p>I was trained as a physicist, completing undergraduate and graduate work in high-energy and astroparticle physics. My doctoral research involved inference for point processes, data analysis using classical statistical methods and machine learning, and numerical modeling of particle transport and interaction within dynamic astrophysical systems. Much of this work was carried out within large experimental collaborations, including IceCube.</p>
                    <p>Over time, my interests have shifted toward the study of social and biological systems. I am especially interested in applications to human populations, where network organization and resource flow play a central role in shaping large-scale societal outcomes and innovation.</p>
                    <p>I am currently completing my doctoral work as a visiting graduate student in Munich and will be on the market for postdoctoral positions beginning in summer or fall 2026.</p>
